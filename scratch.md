# CSSS

This app will be the main entry point for squadrons into the USAFCP. A squadron
rep would sign up and configure how their squadron would use the platform.

They should be able to enable/disable `apps` and `services` for their squadron.
For example, this would be where they configure whether or not they will be
using G-Suite, or if they want to set up `Service XX`.
